# Quick-sort-algorithm-visualizer

This Python-based game utilizes the Tkinter library to showcase the QuickSort algorithm. QuickSort is a sorting algorithm known for its efficiency in sorting elements within an array. The game visualizes the sorting process, providing a dynamic representation of how QuickSort rearranges elements to achieve a sorted order.

## Features

1. **Interactive Visualization:** Tkinter's graphical capabilities are leveraged to create an engaging and interactive interface. Users can witness the step-by-step sorting of elements in real-time.

2. **Sorting Order Display:** The game displays the current order of elements during the sorting process, allowing users to observe how QuickSort rearranges them to achieve the desired order.

3. **Efficiency Analysis:** The game calculates and displays the time taken for the QuickSort algorithm to complete the sorting process. This provides users with insights into the algorithm's efficiency, emphasizing its quick and effective nature.

## How to Run the Game

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the main Python script.
